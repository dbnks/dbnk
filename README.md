# DBNK
dBnk is a decentralized application powered on the [Arisen Blockchain](https://github.com/arisenio/arisen) and distributed over the [dWeb Protocol](https://github.com/distributedweb/) that was originally known as [AriseBank](https://github.com/arisebank). dBnk is the world's first truly decentralized banking application, where users are their own bank, ultimately giving its future users a true alternative to the central banking system.

## WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD?

## THE BLUEPRINT
We have written a [Blueprint](BLUEPRINT.md) for the dBnk application and how it will ultimately function from start to finish. The Blueprint document is being used by dBnk's initial developers and contributors to build out the application itself. This document is constantly changing and being updated by contributors.
